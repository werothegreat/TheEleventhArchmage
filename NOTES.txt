list.index(x) will return the first item in list with value x

list.remove(x) will remove the first item in list with value x

del deletes by key, .remove() removes by value

to split a list, use :
list[1:4] goes from index 1 to index 3
list[:4] goes from beginning to index 3
list[4:] goes from index 4 to end
list[start:end:stride] -> start is inclusive, end is exclusive

list:
for x in list:
	print x

dictionary:
for x in dict:
	print dict[x]

in a function:
foo(*arg) -> *arg signifies an arbitrary number of arguments, and creates a list "arg" in the function of the arguments.

for a list:
print 'x'.join(list) concatenates all elements in a single line, with "x" in between each element.

while:
else:

else will execute whether or not while executes, unless "break" breaks out of while

for/else -> same as while/else, except for will always execute

print('', end='') will not produce a new line.

for index, item in enumerate(list):
will pass the index associated with each item in the list

for a, b, ... in zip(list_a, list_b, ...):
will pass on two (or more) lists at once, ending at the end of shortest list

list comprehension:
new_list = [foo(x) for x in range(i,j) if some condition]
will create a list of foo(x) meeting some condition
